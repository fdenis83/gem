                                                <p>The Data Protection Act of 1998 described how organizations must
                                                    collect, manage, and store Personal Data. The GDPR of 2018 prepared
                                                    regulations of how Personal Data could be retrieved, deleted,

                                                    them. These are two of the lawful regulations that are followed by
                                                    GEM. To comply with these laws, Personal Data must be fairly
                                                    collected and used, stored safely, and not unlawfully disclosed.
                                                    Several steps are taken to protect and secure all data used by GEM.</p>
